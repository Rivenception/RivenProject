# RivenProject
League of Legends - mini project.
Project to help new players and vets with match ups and general Riven knowledge.

Goal: To eventually create a web client for all rivenmains and LoL fans to enjoy.

Masteries.py

Building code to allow users to enter in the lane match up and return helpful tips and tricks.  
I.e. what keystone to take, what riven mechanic can you attempt to exploit for outplay potential, what to build for lane phase.

Combos.py

An attempt at building a combo calculator for Riven player to have on their second monitor or phone.
I want a Riven player to be able to enter in their AD from runes and masteries, character lvl, etc.  Just a few stats.
Ideally, I want the code to return different combos and their dmg output potential for Riven playes.
This is meant to teach or guide Riven players towards learning her combos, kits, and mastering the champion.

Eventually, I want to be able to combine both of these ideas into a simple easy to use GUI and park it on a website for all to enjoy.

About me: I have very little coding experience. I started about two months ago with codeacademy exercises online to learn python.
This project is meant to increase my knowledge of writing and building code to give me an activity to immerse myself in the culture
and daily activities of fellow coders who are more experienced than myself.  I want to learn.  This is a novice level project that
I hope will, in the process of building this, teach me how to use GitHub and get me more involved in other open source projects.

Thanks,
Rivenception
